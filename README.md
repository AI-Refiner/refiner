## Using the Embeddings CLI
The Embeddings CLI is a command-line interface that allows you to convert text, HTML, JSON, and YAML data to embeddings, as well as convert an image file to embeddings. In this guide, we'll walk through how to use the CLI to perform these tasks.

## Installation
To use the Embeddings CLI, you'll need to install the necessary dependencies. You can do this by running the following command:

pip install -r requirements.txt

This will install the required libraries, including spacy, torch, torchvision, beautifulsoup4, json, and yaml.

## Usage
Once you have installed the dependencies, you can use the Embeddings CLI to convert your data to embeddings. Here are the available sub-commands:

## text_to_embeddings
This sub-command takes a text file as input and prints the corresponding embeddings. To use this sub-command, run the following command:

python embeddings.py text_to_embeddings path/to/text/file.txt

Replace path/to/text/file.txt with the path to your text file.

## html_to_embeddings
This sub-command takes an HTML file as input and prints the corresponding embeddings. To use this sub-command, run the following command:

python embeddings.py html_to_embeddings path/to/html/file.html

Replace path/to/html/file.html with the path to your HTML file.

## json_to_embeddings
This sub-command takes a JSON file as input and prints the corresponding embeddings. To use this sub-command, run the following command:

python embeddings.py json_to_embeddings path/to/json/file.json

Replace path/to/json/file.json with the path to your JSON file.

## yaml_to_embeddings
This sub-command takes a YAML file as input and prints the corresponding embeddings. To use this sub-command, run the following command:

python embeddings.py yaml_to_embeddings path/to/yaml/file.yaml

Replace path/to/yaml/file.yaml with the path to your YAML file.

## image_to_embeddings
This sub-command takes an image file as input and prints the corresponding embeddings. To use this sub-command, run the following command:

python embeddings.py image_to_embeddings path/to/image/file.jpg

Replace path/to/image/file.jpg with the path to your image file.

## Conclusion
The Embeddings CLI is a useful tool for converting text, HTML, JSON, and YAML data to embeddings, as well as converting images to embeddings. With this guide, you should now be able to use the CLI to perform these tasks on your own data.
